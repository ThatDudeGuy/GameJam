Maybe have some sort of object behind the player that the enemies damage whenever an enemy gets
past the player without dying.

Or even lose points with each kill missed

Or even a missed kills counter=

FOR SPAWNING OBJECTS AND ENEMIES

	- On an interval
		Spawn platforms at random Y locations between a certain range
		Spawn overworld platforms when the player is in the overworld
		Inverse, spawn underworld platforms when the player is in the underworld
		
	- On an interval
		There is a 33-40% to spawn an enemy on a platform via random number generator
		If an enemy spawns on a platform, there is a random number generated from 1-4
			that will spawn the corresponding enemy based on the underworld and
			overworld.
		Any enemy on a platform will be in an idle animation
		If the enemy is a MUSHROOM or FLYING_EYE or RANGED_ENEMY then they will use only
		ranged attacks
