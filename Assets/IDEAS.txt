Or even lose points with each kill missed

Or even a missed kills counter

FOR SPAWNING OBJECTS AND ENEMIES

	- On an interval
		Spawn platforms at random Y locations between a certain range
		Spawn overworld platforms when the player is in the overworld
		Inverse, spawn underworld platforms when the player is in the underworld
		
	- On an interval
		There is a 33-40% to spawn an enemy on a platform via random number generator
		If an enemy spawns on a platform, there is a random number generated from 1-4
			that will spawn the corresponding enemy based on the underworld and
			overworld.
		Any enemy on a platform will be in an idle animation
		If the enemy is a MUSHROOM or FLYING_EYE or RANGED_ENEMY then they will use only
		ranged attacks

	- When spawning platforms
		when the final one is spawned, spawn a coin right above its location to
		incentivize the player to jump up the platforms


	- CORE LOOP
		endless run, dodge, and kill enemies to rack up points

		different ending for different point values. if the player has 100 or less points
		the bad ennding screen shows, could just be some text. They didnt successfully
		200-600 points they have defended succesfully
		601 > they have annihilated the enemy

		once the player has survived 2-3 waves in the overworld, beams from hell
		will be the only things spawning in the world until the player defeats 3 mushroom
		enemies. Once the objective is fulfilled, many enemies will spawn in the underworld
		until the player goes back to the overworld
